### A movement SWEP that recreates the movement from Super Mario Odyssey

---

This is a port of [PortalRunner's](https://youtu.be/3KIy7M2-Ue4) Portal 2 mod with a couple of addition like audio and some Gmod related bug fixes.

To enable the movement get the weapon from the weapons other tab. The SWEP is called "odyssey movement toggle" and you can toggle it on and off with left click.

Controls:

- **Crouch/Duck(Ctrl)** - Crouch
- **Use(e)** - Throw cappy
- **Jump(Space)** - Jump



These controls are similar to Super Mario Odyssey with **Jump** being **B/A**, **Use** being **Y** and **Crouch** being **ZL**

Movelist:

- Jump
- Long jump - Run then **Crouch** + **Jump**
- Wall jump - While in the air **Jump** while facing a wall
- Roll - While holding **Crouch**, spam **Use** and you start rolling
- Ground Pound - While in the air **Crouch**
- Ground Pound Jump - **Ground Pound** then jump when you hit the floor and you jump higher than normal
- Dive - **Ground Pound** then **Use** to dive out of it
- Backflip - While standing still **Crouch** + **Jump**
- Bonk - **Dive** into a wall (Not really a move)


Known Issues:

- Cappy is missing his eyes, this is because the game has a separate model for the eyes so i need to stich it together


Cappy model and Mario sounds belong to NintendoÂ©

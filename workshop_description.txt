[h3]A movement SWEP that recreates the movement from Super Mario Odyssey[/h3]

This is a port of [url=https://youtu.be/3KIy7M2-Ue4]PortalRunner's[/url] Portal 2 mod with a couple of addition like audio and some Gmod related bug fixes.

To enable the movement get the weapon from the weapons other tab. The SWEP is called "odyssey movement toggle" and you can toggle it on and off with left click.
